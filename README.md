# OpenMusic.API

## A simple API containing songs, artists, albums, playlists and users
Intended to be used by my future front-end Angular, Vue, React and Blazor projects

### Project goals
- Use Microsoft ASP.NET Identity & JWTs
- Provide end points for users to like songs and artists
- Allow users to make  and follow playlists
- Allow admins to add albums/songs
- Store uploaded songs on cloud service (possibly locally during development)
- Playback of audio files
